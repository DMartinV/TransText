"""
This script serves as the functional aspect of this module.
It extracts the textual content of PDF files and saves it into a plain text file. The script uses the 'PyPDF2' library to complete this task. The script first verifies if the input file is a PDF file before starting the extraction process. Once the process is completed, the program adds the textual content into a plain text file.

Usage: $ python function_pdfText.py [-i <pdf_file>] [-o <outputFile>]

Example: $ python function_pdfText.py -i /path/document.pdf -o /path/output.txt

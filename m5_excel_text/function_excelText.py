"""
This script serves as the functional aspect of this module.
It extracts the textual content of Excel files and saves it into a plain text file. The script uses the 'openpyxl' library to complete this task. The function 'extractTextFromExcel' iterates through the Excel's rows and cells, extracting the content and writing it into a plain text file.

Usage: $ python function_excelText.py [-i <excel_file>] [-o <outputFile>]

Example: $ python function_excelText.py -i /path/document.xlsx -o /path/output.txt

"""
This script serves as the functional aspect of this module.
It extracts the textual content of Excel files and saves it into a plain text file. The script uses the 'openpyxl' library to complete this task. The program first verifies if the extension provided is from an Excel file before extracting the text and saving it into a plain text file.

Usage: $ python function_excelText.py [-i <excel_file>] [-o <outputFile>]

Example: $ python function_excelText.py -i /path/document.xlsx -o /path/output.txt
